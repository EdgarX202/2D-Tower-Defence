# 2D-Tower-Defence
An early prototype built for Games Engineering module. </br>
</br>
A 2D top-down tower defence game.</br> 
5 different type towers: </br>
- Ice: Regular damage + has a chance of temporarily slow enemy down.
- Flame: Regular damage + has a chance of doing an extensive damage over short period of time.
- Poison: Regular damage + has a chance of poisoning the enemy that drops poison on the road which can damage other enemies if picked up.
- Electric: Regular damage + has a chance of electrocuting multiple enemies within range
- Normal: Regular damage</br>

4 different enemy types:</br>
- Enemy 1: Resistand to poison tower. Has a shield that provides extra defence.
- Enemy 2: Resistant to electric tower. Can attack the towers.
- Enemy 3: Resistant to flame tower. Increased speed.
- Enemy 4: Resistant to ice tower. Explodes on death that can damage towers that are in range.</br>

Nothing is set in stone and can change during the development.</br>
The plan is:</br>
- To implement handcrafted levels + procedural level generation after the player finishes all normal levels.
- Add more towers and enemies.
- Tower customisation?</br>
