# 2D-Tower-Defence
An early prototype built for Games Engineering module. </br>
A 2D top-down tower defence game.</br> 
* Functioning towers. Can buy/sell/upgrade/shoot. Debuffs are implemented but a little buggy.
* Somewhat functioning enemies. Currently only receive damage and follow the A* path from A to B.
* Procedural map generation.
* Christmas themed UI.
* Pixel art created from scratch.</br>
